This shiny app was created by Sam Carlen (github.com/samcarlen). The data primarily comes from the FBI's National Incident-Based Reporting System (https://www.fbi.gov/services/cjis/ucr/nibrs). The data on fatal police shootings comes from the Washington Post's police shootings database (https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/investigations/police-shootings-database/).
